## Floop: 

Floop enables teachers to give meaningful feedback, faster. 

We set out with a goal of increasing the role of feedback (vs. grading) in the classroom. We're also interested in reclaiming time for teachers who carry around large stacks of notebooks and spend endless hours grading them.  (The average high school teacher can easily have over 200 students at one time). 

We saw a particular pain point with messy work typical in the STEM environment (Graphs, Diagrams, 3D models, mathmatic equations) that currently doesn't play well with computers. Our solution was to create a mobile platform to digitize messy work and facilitate giving feedback on that work, without the need to carry around the 'stack of papers'

## Spacin' Around: 

There are just *24 satellites* responsible for beaming down GPS information to a vast majority of devices that you interact with every day.  When you get down to it, we live relatively cozy little neighborhood that is entirely possible to memorize. ARKit made visualizing that neighborhood possible, and fun. 

My goal with ARGlobe is to guide users to an understanding what's going on in earths orbit. To show what satellite constellations are out there, what they do, what orbits they use, and what they are there for.
