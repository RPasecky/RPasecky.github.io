<h2>Floop:</h2> 

#### Floop enables teachers to give meaningful feedback, faster.

We set out with a goal of increasing the role of feedback (vs. grading) in the classroom. We're also interested in reclaiming time for teachers who carry around large stacks of notebooks and spend endless hours grading them.  (The average high school teacher can easily have over 150 students at one time). 

We saw a particular pain point with messy work typical in the STEM environment (Graphs, Diagrams, 3D models, mathmatic equations) that currently doesn't play well with computers. Our solution was to create a mobile platform to digitize messy work and facilitate giving feedback on that work, without the need to carry around the 'stack of papers'

## Orbital Almanac: 

#### Explore earth's orbit through time in Augmented Reality

My goal with Orbital Almanac is to guide users to a real-time understanding what's going on above our heads in earth's orbit. ARKit made visualizing that neighborhood possible, and fun. User's will be able to explore satellite constellations, what they do, what orbits they use and what paths they will take.
